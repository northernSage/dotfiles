# Macos Scripts

**Macos-specific configuration and software installation scripts**

# How to use

For now, we only have installation scripts here. Each script is named after the
software that it's supposed to install. For example, to install brave browser
and xclip command utility:

``./brave && ./xclip``

*Obs. Some scripts might require ``sudo``*
