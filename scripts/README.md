# Scripts

**Collection of custom bash scripts**

In order to keep vim plugins to a minimum we make heavy usage of bash scripting
and native linux tools integrated with `vim` by using `!!` , `!}` and
`!:<line_number>`.

## How to use

To use the scripts, add this directory to your ``PATH``. For example, if you
clone the repository and ``cd`` into this directory the command could look
like:

``export PATH=$PWD:$PATH``

If you want to make it permanent, just add a similar line to your ``.bashrc``
file.

As you will probably notice, most scripts are meant to be used alongside vim,
tmux or lynx. That doesn't mean you can't change things around to fit your
needs. Feel free to borrow and tweak whatever you need :)
