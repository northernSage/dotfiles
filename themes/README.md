# Terminal and VIM Themes

**Custom themes for VIM and terminal emulator**

Use the provided color pallet and color fix script to make your vim and
terminal emulator pleasent on the eyes.

## How to use

For vim, the gruvbox theme will be installed automatically by vim-plug plugin
manager if you use the ``vimrc`` file provided in this repository. While it may
work out of the box for some, it's usually necessary to fix the color pallet by
running ``grouvboxpallet.sh``.

Personally, I like to match my vim and terminal looks so I have added grouvbox
profile coping the grouvbox theme color pallet. This was intended for gnome
terminal so I can't guarantee it will look good with other emulators.
